## 5. Test Plan Outline

1. **Line regulation.**
   - Set `EN` high, load current fixed at 5 mA.
   - Step `VIN` from 4.5V to 5.5V.
   - Record `VOUT` at each step.
2. **Load regulation.**
   - Set `EN` high, `VIN` fixed at 5.0V.
   - Step load current from 0 mA to 10 mA.
   - Record `VOUT` at each step.
3. **Transient response.**
   - Set `EN` high, `VIN` fixed at 5.0V.
   - Apply a load step, 0 mA to 10 mA, with a 1 µs rise/fall time.
   - Separately, apply a `VIN` step, 5.0V to 4.5V, with a 1 µs rise/fall time, at fixed 5 mA load.
   - Capture `VOUT` in both cases; report overshoot/undershoot and settling time.
4. **PSRR.** Apply a ripple, a small AC signal added on top of the DC input, standing in for supply noise.
   - Set `EN` high, load current fixed at 5 mA.
   - Hold `VIN` at 5.0V DC, add a 50 mV AC ripple, swept 10 Hz to 1 MHz.
   - Measure ripple amplitude at `VOUT`; report attenuation (dB) vs. frequency.
5. **EN control.**
   - Set `VIN` at 5.0V, load current fixed at 5 mA.
   - Drive `EN` high; confirm `VOUT` rises cleanly to 3.3V with no glitches.
   - Drive `EN` low again; confirm `VOUT=0`. 
6. **Quiescent current.**
   - Set `EN` high, `VIN` at 5.0V, and load current at 0 mA (no load).
   - Measure current drawn from `VIN`

## 6. Harness Resources Required

| Resource | Use |
|---|---|
| 5.0V analog supply | `VIN` (supply and pass-device input) |
| Ground | `VSS` |
| Bandgap-referenced bias voltage | `VREF` (1.2V assumed in simulation) |
| 1 digital control (3.3V) | `EN` |
| Analog output pin | `VOUT` (for measuring regulation under external load) |
| 2 shared analog lines | `FB_BUF`, `EAOUT_BUF` test outputs |
| Bandgap-referenced current sources | none (biasing is internal) |

All devices are GF180MCU PDK devices rated for the 5.0V `VIN` domain:
transistors are `nfet_05v0` / `pfet_05v0`, resistors are high-resistance poly
`ppolyf_u_2k_6p0`, and the compensation capacitor is a MIM `cap_mim_2f0fF`. `EN` comes from the harness's 3.3V logic, so it passes through an
internal 3.3V-to-`VIN` level shifter (`xschem/ldo_levelshift.sch`).

### Passive Devices

| Instance | Value | Device | W x L |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Rref` (error-amp tail bias) | 200 kOhm | `ppolyf_u_2k_6p0` | 1 x 95.59 um |
| `RrefFB`, `RrefEA` (test-buffer bias) | 2 MOhm | `ppolyf_u_2k_6p0` | 1 x 957.9 um |
| `R1` / `R2` (feedback divider) | 175 / 100 kOhm | `ppolyf_u_2k_6p0` | 2 x 171.40 / 2 x 97.85 um |
| `Cc` (Miller compensation) | 3.0 pF | `cap_mim_2f0fF` | 38.6 x 38.6 um |

`R1` and `R2` use the same resistor type and width, so their ratio (which sets
`VOUT`) is independent of sheet-resistance and width variation and temperature.

## 7. Simulation Results (schematic, pre-layout)

Typical corner, 27 C, `VIN` = 5.0V, `VREF` = 1.2V, `EN` = 3.3V. Full results,
plots and the process/temperature corner table are in
[`simulations/results/summary.md`](simulations/results/summary.md).

| Parameter | Spec | Simulated |
|---|---|---|
| Output voltage (5 mA) | 3.201V - 3.399V | 3.309V |
| Dropout voltage (10 mA) | max 300 mV | 152 mV (263 mV worst corner) |
| Quiescent current | max 100 uA | 62 uA (95 uA worst corner) |
| Line regulation | max 1% | 0.042% (0.087% worst corner) |
| Load regulation | max 1% | 0.270% (0.81% worst corner) |
| PSRR (low frequency) | min 40 dB | 59 dB at 100 Hz (52 dB worst corner) |

Worst corners: dropout at slow MOS / slow resistors / 110 C; quiescent current
and load regulation at fast MOS / fast resistors / 110 C.

## 8. Repository Layout

| Path | Contents |
|---|---|
| `xschem/ldo.sch`, `ldo.sym` | LDO IP block schematic and symbol |
| `xschem/ldo_levelshift.sch`, `.sym` | 3.3V-to-`VIN` level shifter for `EN` |
| `simulations/tb_*.sch` | One xschem testbench per test in the test plan |
| `simulations/run_sims.py` | Runs all testbenches, plots results, checks against spec |
| `simulations/results/` | Result plots and summary table |
| `netlist/schematic/ldo.spice` | Exported schematic netlist |

## 9. Reproducing the Results

Requires [xschem](https://xschem.sourceforge.io/), [ngspice](https://ngspice.sourceforge.io/),
the gf180mcuD PDK with `PDK_ROOT` set, and Python 3 with numpy and matplotlib
(all included in [IIC-OSIC-TOOLS](https://github.com/iic-jku/IIC-OSIC-TOOLS)).

```sh
cd simulations
python3 run_sims.py --corners
```

Testbenches can also be opened and simulated individually in xschem
(`cd simulations && xschem tb_line_reg.sch`). Schematics reference only files
in this repository or in the PDK via `$PDK_ROOT`.

## 10. Open Items

- Quiescent current has ~5% margin at the fast-resistor / 110 C corner
  (95 uA vs 100 uA); bias currents are set by poly resistors from `VIN`.
- Add an AC loop-gain / phase-margin testbench across corners (current
  stability evidence: load- and line-step transients).
- Load-step overshoot (+312 mV for a 0-10 mA step in 1 us) is not yet
  specified; decide on a transient spec or reduce it.
- Layout in the harness slot (template TBD), DRC/LVS, post-layout PVT.
